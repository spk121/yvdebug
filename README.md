# yvdebug
A graphical debugger for Guile

YVDebug is a graphical debugger for GNU Guile.  It has GNU Guile at is
core, but, offers different ways to use and visualize the information
available at the standard GNU REPL.

The "YV" in YVDebug has no meaning.  It was chosen because it didn't
seem to be taken by any other popular project.

This is just in the planning stages, for now.  Please don't try to use
it.
